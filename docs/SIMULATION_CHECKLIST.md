# Simulation Checklist

- [x] Review existing universe, galaxy, system, and planet classes.
- [x] Define requirements for people viability gating.
- [ ] Implement dynamic event pipeline for civilizations.
- [x] Improve the universe simulator executable to orchestrate subobject ticks.
- [x] Document readiness criteria for population spawning.
- [x] Introduce a blueprint-driven bootstrapper that wires galaxies, systems, planets, and countries together.
- [x] Procedurally generate galaxies, stellar systems, and planets with configurable seeds and object-count targets.
- [x] Lift tick-length clamps so delta experimentation can venture into sub-second or extreme regimes.
- [x] Model resilience/adaptation loops so populations learn from famine and disasters.
- [x] Model relative time dilation per planet and ensure local days/years drive citizen hunger and aging.
- [x] Implement multi-factor planetary habitability analysis and classification to surface colonization priorities.
- [x] Seed climate-driven weather cycles and narrative descriptions for planets, countries, and citizens.
- [x] Establish material, chemical, and taxonomy scaffolding for future matter simulations.
- [x] Flesh out plant, animal, and insect behaviours for ecological modelling.
- [x] Create settlement and housing infrastructure classes to host emerging populations.
- [x] Prototype adaptive habitats (nests, burrows, emergent shelters) that can fail, learn, and evolve alongside their builders.
- [x] Deliver an operator console view to inspect galaxies, systems, planets, and civilizations in real time.
- [x] Ship a desktop control panel that orchestrates common simulator commands without the console.
- [ ] Apply a bespoke visual theme and artwork pipeline for the desktop control panel.
- [ ] Stress-test habitat experimentation loops across multi-season environmental scenarios.
- [x] Surface biosphere composition summaries and economic telemetry throughout the catalog hierarchy.
- [x] Parallelize galaxy advancement with a configurable worker pool to leverage multi-core hosts.
- [x] Stabilize random event sampling so empty catalogs or small populations cannot crash the simulator.
